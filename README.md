# >>> TRUST NO ONE BUT THE CODE <<<

- NO ADMIN, NO SPECIAL ROLES, NO RATS, NO ONE CAN BE FASTER THAN OTHERS, NO RUGS, ALL FUNDS WILL ADD TO THE LP.
- Players participate in fundraising by transferring ETH to the contract.
- Players can transfer tokens to the contract at any time before launch to obtain refunds

## Rules
Players participate in the fair launch game by transferring ETH to the contract.

The contract automatically sends ETH and half of the tokens to the DEX to become a liquidity pool after meeting certain conditions.

After launch, players can claim tokens

If the ETH received by the contract before launch exceeds the preset soft cap, players can claim a partial refund in the contract after launch.

### How to participate in the game?

You can participate by transferring ETH directly to the contract. The transfer amount must be no less than 0.0001.

### How to get tokens?

After the launch of DEX, players transfer 0.0001 ETH to the contract to claim the allocated token airdrop. The number of tokens obtained by the player = user investment amount / total investment amount

### How to get a refund?

At any time before the launch of DEX, players can transfer 0.0002 ETH to the contract to get a refund.

### If the investment soft cap is exceeded, how to get an additional refund?

At any time after the DEX launch, players can transfer 0.0002 ETH to the contract to get a refund for over-invested ETH (if a soft cap is set and the total investment exceeds the soft cap).

After the scheduled launch block is reached, any player can launch ETH and TOKEN to the DEX to start trading by transferring 0.0005 ETH to the contract.

#### >>> All ETH commands sent to the contract (refund\launch\mint...etc.) will be returned to the player<<<
